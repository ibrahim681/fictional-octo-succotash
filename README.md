# 📊 Learning R Through Educational Data

Welcome to my journey of mastering **R** by exploring, analyzing, and visualizing educational datasets! This repository serves as a personal documentation of my progress, key takeaways, and the projects I’ve built along the way.

## 🔍 Overview

This project focuses on learning R by working with educational data, applying various data manipulation, visualization, and statistical techniques. It’s a hands-on approach to reinforce core concepts, discover insights, and build projects with real-world relevance.

## 💡 Learning Objectives

1. **Data Manipulation:** 
   - Cleaning, transforming, and filtering educational data with `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Creating meaningful visualizations using `ggplot2` to showcase trends and insights.
3. **Descriptive Statistics:** 
   - Summarizing data using measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Uncovering patterns and relationships through correlation, box plots, histograms, etc.
5. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Running hypothesis tests and regression analysis to explore educational phenomena.
   
## 📊 Datasets

I’m exploring datasets from various educational sources, including:
- Student performance datasets
- Education spending and outcomes
- Graduation rates and trends
- Other publicly available datasets
